Hi there, I'm Victoria (she/her) and I am:
*  the data analyst for the RevOps team at Relay Inc.
*  an aspiring data scientist
*  a very enthusiastic dog mom

I graduated from UNC in 2017 with a BA in Studio Art and am currently pursuing a graduate certificate in Applied Statistics and Data Management. Outside work and school, you'll usually find me taking my dog Luffy to the park, bouldering at the rock climbing gym, or working on a new drawing.
