This blog was created for ST-558, data science for statisticians and will be updated regularly during the Fall 2021 semester.

### More Information

there! I'm Victoria: dog mom, data analyst, and aspiring data scientist. I work in revenue operations for a small tech company in Raleigh and am pursuing a graduate certificate in Applied Statistics and Data Management.

Outside work and school, you'll usually find me taking my dog Luffy to the park, bouldering at the rock climbing gym, or working on a new drawing.
